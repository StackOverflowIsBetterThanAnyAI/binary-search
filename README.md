# Binary Search

Search for a randomly generated number in an initially shuffled list by making use of binary search.

In the first step, the list is sorted by using the Selection Sort algorithm. After that, binary search is applied to find the desired value.

To get an idea of how much faster binary search is, the same number is determined using a naive linear search. The required time is measured in all cases.

Use a custom list size or go with the default size of 500,000.

```

// size: 500,000
node .

// size: 100
node . 100

```
