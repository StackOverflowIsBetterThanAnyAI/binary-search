# Binary Search

Search for a randomly generated number in an initially shuffled list by making use of binary search.

In the first step, the list is sorted by using the Selection Sort algorithm. After that, binary search is applied to find the desired value.

Use a custom list size or go with the default size of 500,000.

```

// size: 500,000
node .

// size: 100
node . 100

```
